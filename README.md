# SQLQueryProject
A sample SQL query project to sort famous articles and authors based on popularity!
 
""" NOTE: this repository is meant for the Udacity team only. You may check on the code to 
    checkout the awesomeness of my queries. But you won't understand the data it receives  
    unless you have the .sql file of the RDB, which is a property of Udacity. The comments, 
    however, will hopefully make you understand the queries better. """
