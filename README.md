# SQLQueryProject
A sample SQL query project to sort famous articles and authors based on popularity!
To run this application, change directory into this application via bash and run
the command: "python queries.py" from bash. You are then given 3 different queries
to choose from:
1) Find the top 3 articles of all time based on views.
2) Find the top authors of all time on an aggregation count of all article views
   by the same actor.
3) Find the day(s) where the number of errors a website encountered is greater than 1%.

For the results on those queries, kindly refer to the results.text file.
